# VEPAnalysisSuite

Code used in the Gavornik Lab to extract and analyze VEP data.
Core functionality is fine, some developmental paths that we do not use
are still in the suite.  Someday we'll clean everything up, until then
refer to analysis code scripts included as supplemental data for various 
publications to see how it can be used.

This code has been developed over a long period of years, esentially to 
allow people that don't know how to write code analyze data in matlab.  
There are a lot of things that I did early on based on the state of matlab
class capabilities at the time that I would not do again.  If I had a few
weeks of uninterrupted time, I could start fresh and make things under
the hood much simplier than they are but this is unlikely to ever happen.
Such is life.
