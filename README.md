# VEPAnalysisSuite

Code used in the Gavornik Lab to extract and analyze VEP data.
Core functionality is fine, some developmental paths that we do not use
are still in the suite.  Someday we'll clean everything up, until then
refer to analysis code scripts included as supplemental data for various 
publications to see how it can be used.
